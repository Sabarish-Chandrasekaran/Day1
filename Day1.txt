Q2.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
   HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
   HTTP2 where developers can assign each of these data streams a different weighted value, and the value tells the client which data stream to render first.
   Hence HTTP2 is faster,reliable n secure.
